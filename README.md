# Linked Open Data and Knowledge Graphs 

Author:     Finn Heydemann

Lecturer:   Prof. Konrad FÃ¶rstner 


This study explores the integration of antibiotic resistance data from GenBank and RefSeq databases into the publicly accessible Knowledge Graph, Wikidata. Antibiotic resistance poses a significant global health threat, with the misuse of antibiotics leading to the emergence of resistant strains. The project focuses on modeling proteins, genes, chromosomes, bacterial strains, and species in Wikidata, using a comprehensive dataset from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The data cleaning process involves addressing discrepancies and extracting crucial information from the linked databases. Despite challenges, the implementation in Wikidata progresses, with ongoing efforts to link bacterial strains, genes, and proteins. The study highlights the need for standardized entries in databases and emphasizes the potential impact of integrating antibiotic resistance information into Wikidata for global accessibility and collaborative contributions.
